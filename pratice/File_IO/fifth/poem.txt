a ******* is like spring, who nurtures new green sprouts, encourages and leads them, whenever they have doubts.
a ******* is like summer, whose sunny temperament makes studying a pleasure, preventing discontent.*******
a ******* is like fall, with methods crisp and clear, lessons of bright colors and a happy atmosphere.
a ******* is like winter, while it’s snowing hard outside, keeping students comfortable, as a warm and helpful guide.
*******, you do all these things, with a pleasant attitude; you’re a ******* for all seasons, and you have my gratitude!
