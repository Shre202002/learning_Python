A teacher is like Spring, Who nurtures new green sprouts, Encourages and leads them, Whenever they have doubts.
A teacher is like Summer, Whose sunny temperament Makes studying a pleasure, Preventing discontent.teacher
A teacher is like Fall, With methods crisp and clear, Lessons of bright colors And a happy atmosphere.
A teacher is like Winter, While it’s snowing hard outside, Keeping students comfortable, As a warm and helpful guide.
Teacher, you do all these things, With a pleasant attitude; You’re a teacher for all seasons, And you have my gratitude!
